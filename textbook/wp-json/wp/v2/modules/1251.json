Therefore, what you consider to be the most relevant page for a particular search query, may not align with what search engines like Google deem to be most relevant.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about search intent &#8211; remember that?<\/p>\n<p>If Page A ranks for 500 keywords and Page B ranks for 800 keywords &#8211; it\u2019s very likely that there\u2019s going to be some sort of overlap in terms of shared keywords.<\/p>\n<p>However, the critical differentiator here, is that the content on both of these pages will likely serve different search intents.<\/p>\n<p>This is why product pages struggle to rank for informational queries.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the search results for the keyword \u201cbest running shoes\u201d.<\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1322\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final.jpg 810w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-62x40.jpg 62w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-123x80.jpg 123w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-46x30.jpg 46w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-93x60.jpg 93w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-37x24.jpg 37w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-74x48.jpg 74w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-28x18.jpg 28w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-best-running-shoes-result-final-56x36.jpg 56w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/>\n<p>We can see that each of the pages are blog articles as opposed to product or category pages from eCommerce websites selling running shoes.<\/p>\n<p>This boils down to the fact that people searching for this query are not looking for product pages.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean cannibalisation won\u2019t hold you back, because in some cases it can drastically impact your site\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<h2>The (Somewhat) Good, the (Mostly) Bad and (Downright) Ugly Implications of Keyword Cannibalisation<\/h2>\n<h3>Have Mercy on Your Crawl Budget<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a small site, this won\u2019t be much of an issue. But targeting the same keyword on multiple pages means that Google is crawling and indexing pages that offer little value and are probably not needed.<\/p>\n<p>For large eCommerce websites offering multiple variations of products for instance, this could potentially impact your crawl budget (the number of times Googlebot requests to crawl your site) and could effectively result in other important pages not being crawled or indexed.<\/p>\n<h3>Diluted Authority<\/h3>\n<p>When two or more similar pages are battling it out for the same search query, you\u2019re effectively splitting the CTR between them.<\/p>\n<p>On top of this, you\u2019re also diluting the power of the links, the anchor texts used to link to them, as well as the content on the pages themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>Unintentional Rankings<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve got two pages ranking in the first page of Google for the same keyword &#8211; awesome! Not awesome. The star page that you want to rank for, is actually ranking lower than the other one.<\/p>\n<p>This is where it gets pretty ugly, because it means that the page you really want to target is missing out because other, lower quality pages are \u201cstealing\u201d its precious visits.<\/p>\n<h2>The Caveat<\/h2>\n<p>As the heading implies, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom though!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there is one unique case where cannibalisation actually works in your favour.<\/p>\n<p>If you have two pages that are consistently ranking in positions 1 and 2 for the same keyword &#8211; you\u2019ve won the jackpot, and you don\u2019t need to worry about keyword cannibalisation.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this good?<\/p>\n<p>Well, holding the top two spots in the SERPs means CTR (click through rate) will be through the roof, which also means users are less likely to click through to other competing pages lower down the results page.<\/p>\n<p>Where a problem may arise, is in the unlikely case where the page ranking in position #2 had a better CTR than the page in the top spot.<\/p>\n<p>In later modules, we\u2019ll walk you through our own process of identifying and solving different types of keyword cannibalisation.<\/p>\n"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1251"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/module"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1251\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/406"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1251"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
