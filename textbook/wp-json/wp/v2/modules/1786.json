Regardless of how well optimised your content is, there\u2019s no denying that searchers prefer websites that provide them with a good experience.

We\u2019ve seen how page experience ranking factors such as site speed and mobile-friendliness have already been added to Google\u2019s ranking algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2020\/05\/the-science-behind-web-vitals.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">article<\/a> published on May 21st 2020, Google emphasise how Search should be centered around journeys as opposed to pages. Both of the factors that we mentioned above can easily spoil the user\u2019s experience of your website. We\u2019ve already shown you how you can measure how fast your website loads and whether it is mobile-friendly or not, but how do you monitor other experience factors?<\/p>\n<h2>Web Vitals<\/h2>\n<p>In May 2020, Google\u2019s Chrome team <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2020\/05\/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">announced<\/a> a new program called <a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/vitals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Web Vitals<\/a> which is designed to \u201chelp site owners measure user experience on the web\u201d and <em>\u201cidentify opportunities to improve\u201d<\/em>. The idea is to provide webmasters with a universal tool that encapsulates the existing tools and reports that Google already provides, and simplify them with a focus on \u201cthe metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>Core Web Vitals<\/h3>\n<p>The Core Web Vitals are a subset of Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/guides\/page-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">existing page experience signals<\/a> which include load speed, mobile-friendliness, safe-browsing, HTTPS-security and intrusive interstitial guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Although the metrics that make up the Core Web Vitals will change and evolve over time, Google is currently focusing on the three aspects of page experience: loading, interactivity and visual stability. Each of these three aspects have their own corresponding metric.<\/p>\n<p>Google suggests that you should ensure that 75% of your pages meet the recommended targets in order to be assessed as \u201cgood\u201d. Importantly, these should be <em>\u201csegmented across mobile and desktop devices\u201d<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Largest Contentful Paint &#8211; Loading<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Largest Contentful Paint (<a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/lcp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LCP<\/a>) measures how long it takes for the largest piece of content on the web page to load.

It also means that over time, Google will continue to evolve and adapt the metrics that are measured as part of the Core Web Vitals.<\/p>\n<p>Although the relevance of your content is still considerably more important, Google may use page experience signals as a tie-breaker of sorts in cases where <em>\u201cthere are multiple pages that have similar content, page experience becomes much more important for visibility in Search\u201d<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: the marriage between SEO and UX has been strengthened and Google monitoring your Core Web Vitals is another important step you should take in monitoring the SEO health of your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Google &amp; Engagement Metrics<\/h2>\n<p>As we saw earlier in this module, Google Analytics allows you to track how users are interacting with your website. Engagement metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), time on page and bounce rate provide an insight into the user\u2019s experience of a website, so what if Google used this information as part of its ranking algorithm?<\/p>\n<p>A patent originally granted to Google in 2014 and has since been revised multiple times titled \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/patft.uspto.gov\/netacgi\/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=10,229,166.PN.&amp;OS=PN\/10,229,166&amp;RS=PN\/10,229,166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Modifying search result ranking based on implicit user feedback<\/a>\u201d, looks at how Google may use user click-through rates as a ranking factor.<\/p>\n<p>As is the case with every Google patent that we scrutinise in The SUSO Method, this by no means guarantees or confirms that the system is in use. In fact, when SearchEngineLand.com <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/googles-ctr-answer-just-what-youd-expect-and-this-is-why-seos-go-bananas-313176\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">asked Google about this<\/a>, here\u2019s what they had to say in an official statement:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cAs we\u2019ve commented on before, we use interactions in a variety of ways, such as for personalization, evaluation purposes and training data. We have nothing new or further to share here other than what we\u2019ve long said: having great, engaging content is the right path for success. We\u2019d encourage site owners to focus on that big picture\u201d.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What the patent does tell us, is that Google have at the very least considered using user engagement and behaviour as a means to determine which pages should be prioritised by its algorithm. It also shows that they want to protect themselves and prevent other search engines from following suit.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, and the fact that Google may wish to utilise behavioural metrics as a ranking factor in the future, exploring this patent is worth our time.<\/p>\n<h3>Ranking Based on Implicit User Feedback<\/h3>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1794\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1426\" height=\"1006\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback.jpg 1426w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-57x40.jpg 57w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-113x80.jpg 113w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-43x30.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-85x60.jpg 85w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-34x24.jpg 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-68x48.jpg 68w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-26x18.jpg 26w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/11-rakning-based-on-implicit-user-feedback-51x36.jpg 51w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px\" \/>\n<p>The patent introduces the concept of a \u201cresult selection log\u201d which is used to record and measure implicit user behaviour feedback during the user\u2019s search session.<\/p>\n<p>The log also includes negative information such as the search results that the user didn\u2019t click on, the positions of the pages that the user didn\u2019t click as well as the Information Retrieval (IR) scores of the clicked results.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of this patent, an IR Score is part of the Information Retrieval System which looks at how relevant keywords are being used in the page title, headings, in the anchor texts used to point to a page and of course, the main body content.<\/p>\n<p>Other factors such as the user\u2019s cookie, the cookie age, IP (Internal Protocol) address and the user agent of the browser are also logged.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the type of query (i.e. navigational, transactional, informational) is also recorded. This further emphasises the importance of identifying the search intent for the keywords that you want to target for your core landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>The patent also mentions how click data can be used to classify different types of users.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cFor example, computer-savvy users often click faster than less experienced users, and thus users can be assigned different weighting functions based on their click behavior\u201d<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This aligns with one of the reasons Google employees give when it comes to using engagement metrics as a ranking signal &#8211; the fact that they can be too noisy and easy to manipulate. In the above example, \u201ccomputer-savvy users\u201d who click faster may be able to find what they\u2019re looking for much faster and leave a web page than a \u201cless experienced user\u201d. A session like that would likely yield a high bounce rate which of course, is not completely representative of the user\u2019s experience of the web page.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, the patent outlines how this user engagement feedback can be combined with additional external factors such as the user\u2019s location, language used and device (which Google is already collecting and displaying on Google Analytics), to re-rank search queries.<\/p>\n<h3>The Takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>When we consider that Google\u2019s primary goal is to provide users with the best search experience (and results) as possible, it should come as no surprise that they would consider including engagement metrics in their algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>What this patent highlights, is that the way a user interacts with your website has a lot to do with how the content on your page is crafted.<\/p>\n<p>The patent specifically talks about scoring pages based on the positioning of keywords on prominent areas of the page like the page title and headings. This ensures that users are staying on your page as long as possible because they have found what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1786"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/module"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1786\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/414"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1786"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
