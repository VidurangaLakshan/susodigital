If your website is perfectly optimized and a work of on-site SEO art, it still won\u2019t rank without a solid network of links that give it authority.<\/p>\n<p>A backlink is simply one site linking to another &#8211; they do so to support their own content\u2019s authority, to point their users to something worth reading, or to a source of data that they might find interesting or to give credit for a piece of content they are using.<\/p>\n<p>If you have amazing content on your site that you\u2019d like others to find out about, share, talk about and link to &#8211; outreach is the way to alert people to this content and to encourage them to use it as a reference.<\/p>\n<p>While successful outreach is about building links, it\u2019s also about forming relationships with people in your niche. Your outreach emails will reach:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Publishers<\/li>\n<li>Writers<\/li>\n<li>Bloggers<\/li>\n<li>Journalists<\/li>\n<li>WebMasters<\/li>\n<li>Marketers<\/li>\n<li>Business Owners<\/li>\n<li>Business Managers<\/li>\n<li>Content Specialists<\/li>\n<li>Influencers<\/li>\n<li>Publications<\/li>\n<li>Universities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>These are your \u201clink givers\u201d &#8211; and outreachers have the tough job of speaking both to their audience (or that of their clients) and the audiences of the \u201clink givers\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re doing your outreach right, each of these people will have something important to say about what you\u2019re doing, and if you are also passionate about your business, you will have something to teach them or share with them. Thus, an important connection is made.<\/p>\n<h2>Outreach is Personal<\/h2>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1817\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1426\" height=\"1006\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal.jpg 1426w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-57x40.jpg 57w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-113x80.jpg 113w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-43x30.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-85x60.jpg 85w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-34x24.jpg 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-68x48.jpg 68w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-26x18.jpg 26w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-outreach-is-personal-51x36.jpg 51w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px\" \/>\n<p>Since the best kinds of backlinks are organic and natural &#8211; your outreach is going to have to be the same. It\u2019s not enough to zip your whole campaign into a gigantic mail merge and send it to every niche website you can scrape.<\/p>\n<p>It simply doesn\u2019t work like that anymore. Bloggers and business owners get tens if not hundreds of generic outreach every day, and in order for yours to stand out, you have to show them you care about what they\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, unless someone is blatantly trying to sell you a link, they won\u2019t respond to yet another generic guest post email &#8211; would you? Outreach is getting harder and harder &#8211; but it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth it.<\/p>\n<p>But like most things in life, the harder it gets, the more valuable it is &#8211; the links you get have more value and are based on excellent content that will lead users to your page, and result not only in \u201clink juice\u201d, but in more organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Outreach is better when it\u2019s personal because it builds relationships with people from your niche, like a form of networking.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of a Successful Outreach Campaign<\/h2>\n<p>There are many benefits of a successful outreach campaign, and some of them are more measurable than others. While it\u2019s not possible to track exactly how every single specific link affects your page rank and authority, it\u2019s possible to compare your outreach efforts with the changes in your ranking over a period of time.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the unquestionable benefits of an outreach campaign are:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Better SERPs results<\/strong> &#8211; moving up the SERPs means better organic traffic, and more conversions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brand awareness<\/strong> &#8211; the powerful referral traffic you get from outreach will help your brand become more known and increase the conversions on your company website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Authority<\/strong> &#8211; a link is a \u201cvote\u201d for your content. If an authoritative source links to your content, they reference it as a trusted source of information. This doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Brand control<\/strong> &#8211; by promoting your content with the help of outreach, you get to be in control of what is talked about when it comes to your brand. Publication of press releases, using your knowledge to educate people in your niche will put you in control of why people come to you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Networking<\/strong> &#8211; finally, here is a great reason to do outreach aside from rankings. Because you will outreach mostly in your specific niche, it\u2019s a great opportunity to strike a conversation with the people from your neck of the woods. This will create relationships and give you recognition in your specific business community.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h2>How to Conduct A Successful Outreach Campaign<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the steps that you should take to ensure that your outreach campaign is a success.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 1: Research and Plan<\/h3>\n<p>Before you begin outreaching, you need to create a plan of attack. You can\u2019t just write to a blogger and say:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I noticed that you write about fish. I sell aquariums &#8211; would you link to my store?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This approach is correct in a nutshell &#8211; you want this outcome. However, it\u2019s too direct and doesn\u2019t present any value to the blogger or page that you are outreaching to. You\u2019re not letting them see the why. Here\u2019s another way to word it:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI love your fish blog! I\u2019ve been working with tropical fish from South America for several years, and I have a great infographic about their natural habitat &#8211; I\u2019d be happy to let you use it.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here is your chance to tell them:<\/p>\n<p>1. Why you\u2019re interested in their website<\/p>\n<p>2. What you have in common<\/p>\n<p>3. How you can help\/network\/collaborate<\/p>\n<p>4.

These types of pages attract traffic and are relatively easy to link to because of their value. They can be \u201cultimate guides\u201d, helpful charts that people need but no one else has, or simply a collection of content that is already out there, but is much better structured.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a power page is to unequivocally prove that you\u2019re an expert at something &#8211; and this is the page that you ultimately try to prove that your content is better than anyone else\u2019s in the field.<\/p>\n<h4>Step 2 &#8211; Know What\u2019s Out There<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you consider yourself an expert in your niche, take some time to see what\u2019s going on out there SEO wise. Who is ranking the highest? Who is your competition? What content are they ranking with?<\/p>\n<p>When outreaching, you have to put yourselves in the shoes of your prospects as well. Is their site lacking something? Is there something you see that you can help them with?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look a SUSO field example:<\/p>\n<p><em>While doing outreach for a British website that was in the travel niche, we came upon an amazing nature blog that happened to be missing some key bird species in their local bird descriptions section.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>These were the species that our travel client came in contact with and after some research, we outreached to the website owners offering to write a guide to the particular bird species based on our client\u2019s experience and interest in the matter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>A link was born &#8211; not only did it <u>solve the blogger\u2019s problem<\/u> of not having enough content on a popular species, thus making their readers happy, but it recognized our client as an expert in the region\u2019s birdwatching travel destinations. A win-win situation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The article has remained in the top 3 positions in the SERPs for over a year, for client-related keywords.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re armed with a list of the types of content you can provide, you can start the outreach process. There are a few tools that will make it easy on you, and we have listed them in the section below.<\/p>\n<p>You will find that organising your outreach is probably the most difficult task you will encounter.<\/p>\n<h3>Stage 2: Making Connections<\/h3>\n<p>Outreach is straightforward &#8211; before you get buried in emails, content and contacts that is!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s boil it down to a few simple steps:<\/p>\n<h4>Step 1: Prospecting<\/h4>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1821\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1426\" height=\"1006\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting.jpg 1426w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-57x40.jpg 57w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-113x80.jpg 113w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-43x30.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-85x60.jpg 85w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-34x24.jpg 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-68x48.jpg 68w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-26x18.jpg 26w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-prospecting-51x36.jpg 51w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px\" \/>\n<p>Prospecting means making a list of your potential contacts &#8211; and pages that you want to pitch to. There are various paid tools that you can get in order to make it easier on yourself, but in our experience, manual prospecting is always valuable for quality links. Some tools that can help you (they are described fully in the Outreach Tools section below) are:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Pitchbox<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">SEMrush<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ninjaoutreach.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ninja Outreach<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzstream.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">BuzzStream<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mailshake.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mailshake<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/snov.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Snov<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>With their help, you will create a list of perfect niche websites that you can pitch to. They will still have to be sifted through, tweaked and audited before you start sending. Remember that a tool is just a tool &#8211; sometimes when building a perfect prospecting list there will be some suggested sites that just don\u2019t work, or are direct competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Important: don\u2019t ask for links from direct competitors.<\/p>\n<p><u>What information do you need before you write an email?<\/u><\/p>\n<p>It might seem obvious, but here is the abbreviated list:<\/p>\n<p>We have put a simple google sheet together that reflects how a beginning prospect plan should look like. <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1TAVMZn7NE7MAbyqPoc0RXdJiVzyQ31byH7C3uxtV1XE\/edit#gid=1978911108\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Feel free to copy and use it yourself!<\/a> Here is a short explanation:<\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1822\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1261\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1.jpg 1261w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-145x40.jpg 145w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-290x80.jpg 290w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-109x30.jpg 109w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-217x60.jpg 217w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-87x24.jpg 87w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-174x48.jpg 174w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-65x18.jpg 65w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-sheet-explanation-1-130x36.jpg 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px\" \/>\n<p>Here you can keep track of what kind of content you are submitting, the cost of content and any other resources, how it affects your outreach budget, if the link is active or not.

It\u2019s best to include a few main points in your pitch, in order to get your prospect interested and prove that you are interested in reaching <strong>them<\/strong>. Nothing gets deleted faster than a generic mass email. Some of the musts in a pitch are:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Make sure you are addressing the right person<\/li>\n<li>Introduce yourself and explain what you do<\/li>\n<li>Express why you are interested in their website, and why you love their content<\/li>\n<li>Tell them what you\u2019ve been working on (this is where your carrot comes in).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at an example.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve broken this example down into the pitch itself (black text) and some comments on what you should include.do (red text).<\/p>\n<p>Hello Bob,<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Make sure you have the right person, but don\u2019t be forward and pretend that \u201cBobby\u201d is your best friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I know you\u2019re busy, and I\u2019ll try to keep it short. My company is an up-and-coming competitor in the Southern California real estate market, and your interior design blog has really inspired us when we set up for viewings and open houses.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Here, we have both an introduction, and a statement of relevance and connection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I especially love your take on retro design.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It\u2019s helpful when you show that you actually care about what they do and you meant to write to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To the point &#8211;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(Here is where you extend an idea for collaboration. It can be anything, depending on how much you want this particular link, the level you\u2019re willing to commit yourself, and the kind of content you\u2019re working with.

It\u2019s about 1200 words long and I\u2019d love to send you a copy if you want to take a look.<\/li>\n<li>We have a complete guide on the preservation of historic buildings in California &#8211; along with materials lists, prices and examples.

But not too many!

Don\u2019t just \u201cask for a link\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can also clearly see how it\u2019s not something for nothing &#8211; Bob has put a lot of effort into crafting his content so it appeals to a niche of real estate audience interested in historic homes.<\/p>\n<p>If Bob also sells modern homes, his pitch might go a bit differently to those websites interested in modern architecture and design, or modern environment conscious and drought-friendly landscaping.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, Bob needs to invest in his own content before anyone is interested enough to link to his site. You can offer guest posts alone, but that doesn\u2019t have the same potential as content that is<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Sharable<\/li>\n<li>Useful<\/li>\n<li>Original<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>This is what\u2019s going to make people not only click on your link but stay on your site.<\/p>\n<h4>Step 3: Following Up<\/h4>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1828\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1426\" height=\"1006\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up.jpg 1426w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-57x40.jpg 57w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-113x80.jpg 113w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-43x30.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-85x60.jpg 85w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-34x24.jpg 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-68x48.jpg 68w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-26x18.jpg 26w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-following-up-51x36.jpg 51w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px\" \/>\n<p>Don\u2019t be upset if you don\u2019t get an answer right away. Of course, sometimes you will! But according to our experience, about <strong>30% of valuable responses come from follow-ups<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Outreach tools like Pitchbox and Snov are great at setting up follow-up emails automatically. If you don\u2019t want to use tools like that yet, Gmail has a few plugins that will help you control your follow-ups in an organized manner, moving your emails from one section of the \u201coutreach funnel\u201d to the next. Some of the Gmail extensions we like are:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.streak.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Streak<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gmelius.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Gmelius<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mailtrack.io\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Mailtrack<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>Usually, it\u2019s best to check in if you haven\u2019t received a response in 3 or 4 business days. The follow up should be short and to the point.<\/p>\n<p>Below is an example of a great follow up email:<\/p>\n<p><em>Hello Bob,<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I haven\u2019t heard back from you and I was wondering if you had a chance to look over my ideas.

Here are the basic tools that everyone who is doing outreach should have.<\/p>\n<h4>Ahrefs<\/h4>\n<p>Ahrefs is probably the number one program for any outreach campaign &#8211; it is the perfect multitasker, showing you not only how a page ranks, but also what your competition is doing, who is linking them and what content is the most popular amongst many others.<\/p>\n<p>We use it in outreach for:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Looking at competitor backlinks<\/li>\n<li>Analysing pages that we want to link to &#8211; are they worth our time?<\/li>\n<li>Checking what content is popular in a particular niche<\/li>\n<li>Seeing what content gap exists between a client and their competition<\/li>\n<li>Expanding our prospect lists by finding relevant high ranking websites<\/li>\n<li>Tracking progress and page rank<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h4>MOZ<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from all the paid services that MOZ provides, they have some great free tools you can use when you\u2019re starting to outreach, namely their Keyword Explorer, Link Explorer, and the Moz Bar.<\/p>\n<p>This tool also helps with<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Competitor analysis<\/li>\n<li>Keyword research<\/li>\n<li>Local ranking factors (a great help with topics and valuable keywords)<\/li>\n<li>Educational materials for our team members<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h4>Hunter.io<\/h4>\n<p>This tool is great for extracting email addresses from websites that you\u2019d like to outreach to. This tool has a free version, with 50 free email checks. If you\u2019d like to have more than that, you can upgrade to their paid version which can range anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000 email checks a month.<\/p>\n<h4>Social Media<\/h4>\n<p>Social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are great tools for reaching out to people who run blogs and websites. Sometimes, the \u201ccontact us\u201d form is a poor way of starting out a relationship, and if you contact a writer or entrepreneur through more creative channels, you might gain access to them quicker and on a more personal level.<\/p>\n<h4>Wayback Machine<\/h4>\n<p>The Wayback Machine (or archive.org\/web\/) is a great and fun tool that you will probably spend an hour on just going back in time on your favourite websites. We use this tool to see what a website used to look like months, or even years ago. It\u2019s great at spotting domains that were bought recently and changed into PBNs. And best of all, it\u2019s free!<\/p>\n<h4>Surfer SEO<\/h4>\n<p>As we\u2019ve seen in our Content Optimisation module, Surfer SEO is a great tool for editing your content and optimizing it for keywords, depending on article length. It\u2019s one of the best tools used for planning content based on what the competition is doing.<\/p>\n<h4>Grammarly<\/h4>\n"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1815"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/module"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1815\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/415"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1815"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
