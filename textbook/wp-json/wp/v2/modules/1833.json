In other words, you don\u2019t want the hyperlink towards your website to be buried deep into the article as it\u2019s possible that users may not even reach the bottom of the page before leaving.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Anchor Text<\/strong> &#8211; the anchor text should be naturally placed in the content and look organic &#8211; this can work very well even if you\u2019re using a branded anchor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Article Length<\/strong> &#8211; generally speaking, longer is better. Having said that &#8211; before you start writing 1000 words titled \u201cA Short Reminder About Daylight Savings Time and How to Ease Into It\u201d &#8211; context first, then length.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Headers<\/strong> &#8211; it\u2019s important to include H1, H2 for ease of navigation because Google uses headers to better understand what the article is about. Use keywords when you compose your headers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Article Relevance<\/strong> &#8211; your link has to be relevant to the article. Don\u2019t just force your link to your accounting business into an article about seasonal allergies. It won\u2019t work &#8211; and Google will see it as being completely non-relevant.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Structure and Grammar<\/strong> &#8211; readability is important. It\u2019s important to have headers in place &#8211; preferably ones that are descriptive and have the right keywords. Don\u2019t over optimize your content and make it easy to read. Take a look at other articles on the page you\u2019re going to be posting on. How are they structured? Follow their guidelines, and ask for them ahead of submitting your post.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Supporting Visual Content<\/strong> &#8211; it\u2019s best if it\u2019s yours! Anyone can download great photos from free sites like Unplash or have a stock account at the ready. But if you submit and publish your own original content, it\u2019s going to enhance the quality of your post and make your content recognized. Don\u2019t forget the Image Alt Tags! They shouldn\u2019t be stuffed with keywords but descriptive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Bonus:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Link Title Attribute<\/strong> &#8211; this is a little link description that the readers can see when they hover over your link. It\u2019s helpful when it says \u201cgreat resource here\u201d or \u201cbuy chocolate now\u201d &#8211; but not very helpful when stuffed with annoying keywords or a copy of the URL.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Author Bio and Credit<\/strong> &#8211; if you have several great articles about a specific niche under your belt, your name and bio appearing under your article might in itself become a ranking and trust factor.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keywords in webpage names<\/strong> &#8211; especially if they\u2019re associated with you &#8211; this is why it\u2019s nice to develop relationships, and be able to have a clear and open conversation about the guest post process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Optimising Guest Post Text for SEO<\/h2>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1836\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1395\" height=\"851\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo.jpg 1395w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-66x40.jpg 66w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-131x80.jpg 131w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-49x30.jpg 49w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-98x60.jpg 98w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-39x24.jpg 39w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-79x48.jpg 79w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-30x18.jpg 30w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12-optimizing-guest-post-text-for-seo-59x36.jpg 59w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1395px) 100vw, 1395px\" \/>\n<p>The time of keyword stuffing is long gone, but the text has to be readable both for readers and for google. The text has to look natural and organic, but be optimized for your chosen keywords.<\/p>\n<p>First, think about where you\u2019re going to be publishing. This is going to be different from posting on your own page &#8211; because you\u2019re NOT posting on your own page! What will make THEM rank better?<\/p>\n<p>Your link will ride their wave.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use long tail keywords<\/strong> when you write the title tags &#8211; it makes your content stand out from the competition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid keyword cannibalization<\/strong> by using different keywords throughout different guest posts that you post on different websites. For example, you want to avoid posting articles with the same exact anchors and keywords in 10 articles that you publish on a given month. You don\u2019t need an algorithm to tell you that something is fishy here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Title Tags are crucial<\/strong> &#8211; don\u2019t stuff them full of your own keywords &#8211; think of the user intent and why they\u2019re on the site to begin with.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Headings<\/strong> &#8211; Include an H1 tag and supporting H2 tags. It makes the article more organized. Remember not to copy and paste from the title tag &#8211; make an original heading. This gives you more opportunity to properly describe and classify what your article is about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Meta description<\/strong> &#8211; it\u2019s always a good idea to include your own &#8211; you\u2019re going to help the publisher out and seem more organized, but these are often left up to the publisher.<\/p>\n<p>Use tools like Yoast or Surfer and Grammarly to help you with your text.<\/p>\n"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1833"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/module"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1833\/revisions"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/415"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1833"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
