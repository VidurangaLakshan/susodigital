There is this famous quote by John Deere that we like to recall in SUSO: \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideas are easy. Execution is everything<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d and that&#8217;s exactly what SUSO does when it comes to company culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>You Never Get a Second Chance to Make a First Impression<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe companies really interested in the partnership relationship should take care of it from the very first moment, simply by having salary ranges in their job offers. This is what immediately caught my attention when I was contacted by SUSO\u2019s HR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are dozens of recruiters out there sending mass messages on LinkedIn claiming they have a perfect job offer for me based on my profile. If they really got to know my profile, they would know how important salary ranges are for me and would not send me offers without them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This single salary range hint already let me know that SUSO was exceptional, and their organisational values were something more than just empty words.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Your Feedback is More Than Welcome<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few weeks later I joined SUSO and immediately got into the whirlwind of onboarding. The process was smooth and understandable but the more knowledge about the company, operating procedures or tools I gained, the more areas for improvement I kept finding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I started to design a new onboarding process &#8211; no one actually asked me to do that, I just thought I could arrange its elements a little better as a freshman and I was just personally curious about the outcome. When I finished I showed it to my Team Leader Paulina Krakowiak and she liked it. I guess in some companies this is where the story would end, but not in SUSO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long story short, my insights were appreciated to the extent that they were incorporated into the new company\u2019s OKRs (Objective Key Results &#8211; yes, we have something like that because besides our normal everyday work we want to develop ourselves and become better and better). And you need to remember that I was on my probation back when I started to design this new onboarding, which means SUSO didn\u2019t have a problem with listening to a total newcomer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A flat structure is defined as an organisational structure with only a few layers of management, with a short chain of command. For me, the most visible example of this aspect in SUSO (and probably one of my favourites) are the Monthly CEO Catch Ups with our CEO, Will Bagnall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are calls during which he provides us with detailed updates and news about the company:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A summary of our progress for the current objectives.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the necessary stats about how we\u2019re performing as a company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The directions we\u2019re heading i.e. new deals, new clients and new recruits.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A celebration of both company and personal achievements. Last month, it was my turn to be in the spotlight, because of a successful DISCOvery Month that I carried out for one of my clients<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3225 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco.png\" alt=\"Gracjan\" width=\"311\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco.png 1345w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-1076x1536.png 1076w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-1008x1439.png 1008w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-904x1290.png 904w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-28x40.png 28w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-56x80.png 56w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-21x30.png 21w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-42x60.png 42w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-34x48.png 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-13x18.png 13w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/disco-25x36.png 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do I like it that much? Because this way we know that our CEO is not some kind of mysterious elusive creature like Nessie or Yeti, but a living person interested not only in his spreadsheet\u2019s numbers. It\u2019s a feeling that you\u2019re not just a meaningless cog in a machine but again &#8211; a valued member of the team. Finally, that\u2019s what makes the difference between being managed and being led.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>In Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUSO company culture is first and foremost people\u2019s first culture.
