Based on these characteristics, Google Quality Raters evaluate the overall quality of your page and the content it provides.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Needless to say, pages with poor-quality content may have some trouble in reaching their audience, as Google wants to reward sites that bring real value to their visitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Raters pay attention to things like the expertise of an author, the trustworthiness of the website, and its position and reputation in an industry, among other things, in order to rate the YMYL pages and other types of pages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Google is asking: is the content provided coming from a source that users can trust?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you\u2019re searching for advice on how to fill out your tax returns, you\u2019re more likely to trust the information if it\u2019s coming from a reputable accounting firm or a respected finance expert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we are going to focus primarily on the added E in E-A-T, which is all about <\/span><b>Experience.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is E-E-A-T A Ranking Factor?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we skip to the good part, though, it\u2019s crucial to explain whether E-E-A-T is an official ranking factor for Google. Since we\u2019ve established that Google places a lot of significance on E-E-A-T, it wouldn\u2019t be so out of place to assume just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that is not the case\u2026 At least, not officially.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Google <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2022\/12\/google-raters-guidelines-e-e-a-t\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that: \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these guidelines are what are used by our search raters to help evaluate the performance of our various search ranking systems, and <\/span><\/i><b><i>they don&#8217;t directly influence ranking<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They can also be useful to creators seeking to understand how to self-assess their own content to be successful in Google Search.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-E-A-T is not going to determine the ranking of your site, but it still plays a vital role in understanding how Google rates content and what it wants to promote to its users.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Does the New E Stand For?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The added E stands for Experience. But what exactly does that mean for website owners?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this context, Google Quality Raters will consider the <\/span><b>first-hand experience of an author<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to determine whether the content they produce is of high quality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is crucial when <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/blog\/how-to-write-product-reviews-the-google-way\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing product reviews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which discuss products and services after being tested.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google views useful content as content that offers real value, and the experiences of an author are not meaningless here. Quite the contrary &#8211; they can help customers make informed decisions about their purchases and choices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you\u2019re reviewing running shoes, it\u2019s important that you talk about your experience with them, all their qualities, cons, and pros.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re giving a Tiramisu recipe, you should make it known that you\u2019ve tried the recipe yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re writing a guide on what to see in the capital of Spain, it should be clear that you\u2019ve been there and you\u2019re sharing your best tips and real-life experiences, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Kind of Pages Does Experience Affect?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what pages are affected by E-E-A-T the most? I already mentioned reviews, which are pieces of content that heavily rely on the author\u2019s personal experiences with the products or services. However, these rating guidelines cover much broader ground than only review pages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, previously E-A-T, and now E-E-A-T are applicable to almost any type of content. Experience is considered when rating Your Money Your Life pages as well as social media posts and forum discussions (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">source<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, page 62).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also significant to know that, in some cases, Google does not necessarily require authors to be experts in the topics they\u2019re covering, as long as they have this real-life, first-hand experience. While it does not apply to every topic and page, as some YMYL pages should be written by specialists, some types of information or recommendations can be made by regular users and everyday people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see this clearly in examples provided for Google raters in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google&#8217;s Quality Raters Guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (page 28).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4882\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines.png\" alt=\"Google's quality raters guidelines\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines.png 913w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-904x519.png 904w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-70x40.png 70w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-139x80.png 139w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-52x30.png 52w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-105x60.png 105w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-42x24.png 42w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-84x48.png 84w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-31x18.png 31w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/google-quality-raters-guidelines-63x36.png 63w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can share your tips on how to save money and manage your budget, provided that you\u2019ve had similar issues and you\u2019ve learned how to overcome them, but you shouldn\u2019t offer financial advice on what to invest in on a stock market if you\u2019re not an expert in this field.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Experience factor in E-E-A-T can be applied to almost any type of content, so it\u2019s useful to consider it whenever it\u2019s possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips on How To Demonstrate Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so we know that first-hand experience matters.

Well, there are many things that you can do, one of which is to invite people with experience and expertise to write the content for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I mentioned before, the reputation of an author is an important factor for E-E-A-T. If you\u2019re not an expert yourself, it\u2019s much better to give the stage to someone who is and can create high-quality content that brings lots of value to your audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may also help you build your trustworthiness by associating with authors that already have established reputations and positions in their fields. Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to people who have real-life experiences and extensive knowledge of the topics you want to cover.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially important for YMYL pages. If you\u2019re going to give people advice on what to invest in or whether or not CBD oils are safe to use, it\u2019s better that this advice comes from someone with vast knowledge, expertise and experience in these topics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience Is Important, But Being Trustworthy Is Key<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness are all needed to establish whether or not a page is a trustworthy source of information &#8211; and that is what matters the most to Google and Google\u2019s Quality Raters. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4886\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust.png\" alt=\"Trust in E-E-A-T\" width=\"600\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust.png 937w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-904x480.png 904w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-75x40.png 75w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-151x80.png 151w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-56x30.png 56w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-113x60.png 113w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-45x24.png 45w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-90x48.png 90w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-34x18.png 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/trust-68x36.png 68w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the expertise of an author is often a crucial pillar in determining the quality of content, sometimes experience plays a bigger role. For example, a website focused on offering recipes for French dishes doesn\u2019t have to be created by a French chef to be viewed as trustworthy. In this case, it\u2019s more important for an author to have experience in cooking French cuisine because this will be enough to provide reliable information to the audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between expertise and experience is important to recognise here. Expertise combines knowledge and experience, which is valuable when talking in-depth about topics that regard one\u2019s health, well-being, financial standing, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience can be obtained without expertise, and it\u2019s something Google recognises and values as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, it all comes down to how reputable and trustworthy your site is. \u201c<\/span><b><i>Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">source<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, page 27)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why you should always focus on the big picture, making sure the people who create content for it are knowledgeable and experienced. There are no shortcuts here, but the effort is worth the reward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-E-A-T is an important measure of quality that Google considers when working on their algorithms. This means it\u2019s something all content creators and website owners should pay attention to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience is now one of the aspects that can shine some light on how the content was created, what value it brings, and is it a reliable source of information. So, it\u2019s worth making sure that your experience in a topic is not overlooked.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the time being, E-E-A-T is here to stay, offering us great guidelines for how content online is being evaluated and what can influence the rankings. <\/span><\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div clas=\"acfTesting\"><\/div>\n\n\t<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"acf-block-spacer-block_21301388b4bd1584167c8bb3e24d67d8\" class=\"acf-block-spacer c-pt-9\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<style>\ntable.blueTable {\n  border: 1px solid #1C6EA4;\n  background-color: #D9ECFF;\n  width: 100%;\n  text-align: center;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  margin-top: 30px;\n}\ntable.blueTable td, table.blueTable th {\n  border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\n  padding: 3px 3px;\n}\ntable.blueTable tbody td {\n  font-size: 11px;\n  color: #333333;\n  display: table-cell;\n  padding: 5px;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  font-family: Campton,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Roboto,Helvetica Neue,Arial,sans-serif,Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Noto Color emoji;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead {\n  background: #9C7FB1;\n  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #444444;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead th {\n  font-size: 11px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  color: #FFFFFF;\n  text-align: center;\n  border-left: 1px solid #D0E4F5;\n   font-family: Campton,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Roboto,Helvetica Neue,Arial,sans-serif,Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Noto Color emoji;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead th:first-child {\n  border-left: none;\n}\n\ntable.blueTable tfoot td {\n  font-size: 14px;\n}\ntable.blueTable tfoot .links {\n  text-align: right;\n}\ntable.blueTable tfoot .links a{\n  display: inline-block;\n  background: #1C6EA4;\n  color: #FFFFFF;\n  padding: 2px 8px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\ntd img {\n    max-width: 70px !important;\n}\n<\/style>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5798,"template":"","rd_category":[39],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 -
