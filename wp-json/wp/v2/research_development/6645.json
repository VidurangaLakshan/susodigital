This guide will help equip marketing managers with the knowledge and tools to transform their clients&#8217; perception of SEO, turning it from confusion to a potent tactic in their marketing mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand the Client\u2019s Perspective<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clients can often have preconceived notions about SEO, fueled by quick-fix promises, an outdated understanding and SEO myths that have become fact. As a marketing professional, the first step you can take to debunk these common misconceptions is to understand their perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding these concerns is crucial for any business owner or marketer hoping to leverage SEO effectively. By addressing these head-on, you can build trust, set realistic expectations, and ultimately guide clients towards achieving their online goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;SEO takes too long&#8221;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While TikTok&#8217;s instant virality might be tempting, SEO is more like running a marathon. It&#8217;s a long-term strategy that builds organic, sustainable growth for your website, unlike a momentary TikTok-driven spike that fades as quickly as it appeared. Everything your client invests adds up over time and they will receive traffic even years after publishing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, whilst you can\u2019t promise them they\u2019ll hit the top positions overnight, you can promise that the consistent progress they\u2019ll achieve through SEO will translate to long lasting benefits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s just blogging, I can do that myself\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While anyone can dabble in SEO basics, navigating Google&#8217;s complexities and nuances for optimal results is like trying to summit a mountain in sandals. Specialised knowledge is your client\u2019s oxygen mask, constant monitoring of their crampons, and professional guidance from their sherpa \u2013 all crucial for a safe and successful ascent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO encompasses a constantly evolving landscape of algorithms, technical intricacies, and competitor analysis. Trying to juggle it all while running a business can be overwhelming for your client, potentially leading to missteps and missed opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/services\/white-label-seo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experienced SEO professionals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is like hiring a seasoned guide who knows the terrain, anticipates the weather shifts, and optimises your route for a smooth and efficient climb with your client. They possess the expertise to identify hidden weaknesses, leverage the latest industry insights, and implement data-driven strategies that truly move the needle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By focusing on your core strengths and letting skilled professionals handle their SEO ascent, clients can unlock the potential for faster, more sustainable growth, reaching the peak of online visibility with greater ease and confidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018How do I measure the ROI?\u2019\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO ROI, or Return on Investment, isn&#8217;t just about getting more eyes on your client\u2019s website. It&#8217;s about transforming those visitors into valuable leads and customers, ultimately boosting their bottom line.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By optimising your client\u2019s website for search engines, you can position them to attract qualified traffic interested in what they offer. This means higher conversion rates, increased sales, and a tangible return on their SEO efforts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a marathon, not a sprint, but the long-term benefits of a well-executed SEO strategy can far outweigh the initial investment, making it a powerful tool for growth in today&#8217;s digital landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convey the Basics of SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a marketing manager, conveying the basics of SEO is key because it empowers clients to understand how their online presence thrives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using relatable analogies, you can break down complex concepts into digestible bites, fostering collaboration and buy-in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, imagine your client\u2019s website as a restaurant tucked away on a side street. They have the most delicious food in town, but nobody knows they\u2019re there. SEO is like putting up bright signs leading straight to their door.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s how you could explain the core components of SEO to clients:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Crawling &amp; Indexing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Search engines are like neighbourhood scouts, constantly roaming the web streets. They crawl websites by following links, like breadcrumbs, to discover new content. These pages are stored in an index, creating a giant map of the online world.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Technical SEO<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Think of this as making sure your client\u2019\u00a0 restaurant is accessible and inviting. It ensures their website speaks the search engine\u2019s language. Broken windows, flickering lights, or a confusing layout will keep the scouts away.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>On-Page SEO<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Now, let&#8217;s dress up your client\u2019s menu and storefront. On-page SEO is like using keywords, the names of your delicious dishes, throughout your website. This signals to the scouts what your client offers and attracts diners searching for specific meals. Clear descriptions, eye-catching pictures, and helpful tips like &#8220;bestseller&#8221; act like enticing smells wafting out, drawing people in.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Link Building<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Imagine other restaurants linking to your client\u2019s website, recommending their food to their patrons. Link building is like getting good reviews \u2013 the more high-quality websites linking to them, the more trustworthy and popular their restaurant appears to the search engines.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By conveying the basics of SEO in a clear and relatable manner, you not only empower your clients with knowledge but also strengthen your relationship with the client. This understanding fosters collaboration, trust, and ultimately leads to more effective SEO strategies and improved online visibility for their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain the Value of SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ever-evolving space of marketing channels, your client\u2019s may have a focus on new players like Rumble, TikTok, LinkedIn personal ads to provide a fresh opportunity, but all the while SEO is the quiet giant in the room.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what we mean:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than half of all website visitors, a whopping 53.3%, find their way to sites via organic search (Source: BrightEdge).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A staggering 92.96% of global internet traffic is funnelled through just three major platforms: Google Search, Google Images, and Google Maps (Source: SparkToro).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6647\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand.jpg\" alt=\"Global Internet Traffic\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-1008x567.jpg 1008w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-904x509.jpg 904w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-500x281.jpg 500w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-542x305.jpg 542w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-71x40.jpg 71w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-142x80.jpg 142w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-53x30.jpg 53w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-107x60.jpg 107w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-43x24.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-85x48.jpg 85w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-32x18.jpg 32w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SEO-demand-64x36.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites that embrace search engine optimization strategies reap a windfall of visitors, attracting over 1,000% more traffic compared to those relying solely on organic social media promotion (Source: BrightEdge).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For 6 out of 10 marketers, inbound strategies like search engine optimization and blog content reign supreme as the most reliable sources of high-quality leads (Source: HubSpot).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leads nurtured through search engine optimization demonstrate a remarkable 14.6% close rate, outperforming other lead generation methods (Source: HubSpot).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition Google is by far the most used platform in terms of daily users and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/consumer-trends\/the-changing-face-b2b-marketing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">71% of B2B buyers&#8217;<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> journeys start with a generic search on Google in which the brands found enter consideration, then decision phases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO operates as the invisible bridge connecting the online world to your client\u2019s business goals. By optimising their website and content for search engines, clients can increase their visibility, essentially placing themselves front and centre for potential customers seeking solutions that they offer. This enhanced presence translates directly into tangible benefits, boosting brand awareness as users encounter their company more often.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improved SEO attracts qualified leads as relevant users find the right content, turning mere website visitors into engaged prospects.

This can often be missed by clients who see SEO as a stand alone investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few short explanations that can help you shift your client\u2019s SEO perspective:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Brand Awareness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Think of every search as an opportunity to introduce your client\u2019s brand to potential customers. Higher rankings on relevant keywords improves <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/blog\/building-agency-brand-awareness-through-seo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brand awareness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and make them more discoverable, putting their brand name and message in front of interested audiences who are actively searching for solutions they offer. This builds brand recognition and trust as users are more likely to revisit websites that they\u2019ve seen high on the SERPS.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Lead Generation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: SEO attracts qualified leads by targeting searches with high purchase intent. By optimising your website and content for relevant keywords, your clients can attract users actively seeking similar products or services. This targeted traffic converts better, as visitors are already primed for engagement and closer to the buying decision.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Revenue Growth<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Increased brand awareness and targeted leads naturally translate to revenue growth. With more people discovering their brand and qualified leads entering the sales funnel, they have more opportunities for conversions and sales. SEO optimises websites for conversions, guiding users seamlessly towards desired actions like purchases or subscriptions, maximising the return on your marketing investment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, SEO acts as a magnet, attracting the right audience, nurturing their interest, and ultimately driving them towards your business goals. As such, it can integrate into your social media campaigns, PR campaigns and marketing KPIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlight the Importance of Collaboration<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the expertise and capacity to stay abreast of Google\u2019s ever-evolving search algorithms, best practices can be overwhelming. Collaborating with a team of SEO experts allows you to tap into a vast pool of expertise without the overhead of building an in-house SEO team. This ensures your clients SEO campaigns benefit from the latest strategies and tactics, giving them a competitive edge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But beyond expanding your capacity, an SEO partner can enable you to take on more clients without sacrificing quality. By outsourcing the SEO legwork, you free up your internal resources to focus on core agency tasks like client management and creative development. This translates to faster turnaround times, improved efficiency, and the ability to scale your business efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, collaboration also provides an extra layer of support for monitoring and optimising your clients&#8217; campaigns. Your SEO partner should constantly track performance metrics, identify areas for improvement, and make adjustments as needed. This proactive approach ensures your clients&#8217; websites stay visible on search engine results pages (SERPs), driving organic traffic and conversions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaboration with an SEO partner offers a multitude of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/blog\/advantages-of-white-label-seo-solutions-for-agencies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits for agencies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, from unlocking expertise and expanding capacity to providing ongoing campaign support and access to cutting-edge tools. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showcase Success Stories<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO case studies provide concrete evidence of the positive impact that SEO can have on a business, and they can help to overcome common objections that clients may have about SEO.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When choosing SEO case studies to use, marketing managers should select studies that are relevant to their clients&#8217; industry and target audience. They should also focus on studies that show results that are aligned with the client&#8217;s goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a client is migrating their domain, you should select a case study that shows how SEO helped maintain (and ideally grew) a similar site migration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When presenting SEO case studies to clients, focus on the key takeaways and highlight the results that are most relevant to the client. They should also be prepared to answer any questions that the client may have about the study or about SEO in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an SEO partner, they should be happy to join your calls with clients and be comfortable answering SEO questions confidently.

Delve into your client&#8217;s niche, analyse their competitor landscape, and gauge their current SEO standing. This groundwork allows you to co-create achievable goals\u2014not aspirational fantasies. Outline these goals with clear milestones along a realistic timeline, providing both direction and a tangible sense of progress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparency is key. Clearly explain SEO&#8217;s multifaceted nature: a constant interplay of search engine algorithms, market trends, and even competitor moves. Emphasise that SEO is a gradual process, with progress unfolding over months, not days. It&#8217;s a blend of controllable factors (on-page optimisation, content strategy) and uncontrollable ones (algorithm updates, competitor activity). Patience and continued effort are the cornerstones of success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doubt often creeps in when clients feel they&#8217;re in the dark. Combat this by establishing a reporting schedule. Showcase tangible improvements in metrics relevant to your customised strategies. Be ready to explain the &#8220;why&#8221; behind each data point, demonstrating your expertise and commitment to their growth. Remember, consistent progress, even gradual, speaks volumes louder than empty promises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By managing expectations upfront, educating about the process, and consistently showcasing progress, you build trust and set the stage for a successful, long-term SEO partnership.
