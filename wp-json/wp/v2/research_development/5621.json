The progressive march of artificial intelligence is met with jubilation by some and deep scepticism by others. Amidst the frenzy you may have missed the new kid on the block: Tangential SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a newish term picked up by several communities, including a recent post by<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/tangential-seo\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Journal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, the discussion on tangentially relevant content has existed for years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An article published as early as 2017 by Moz titled<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/tangential-content\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tangential Content Earns More Links and Social Shares in Boring Industries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> addresses the exact same idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s safe to say tangential SEO is a new buzzword, but it\u2019s also an old concept. Here\u2019s what you need to know:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is Tangential SEO?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tangential SEO is the intentional decision to prioritise and create content not related to your core business offering but nevertheless reaches your target demographic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the best example comes from the world\u2019s largest tire manufacturer, Michelin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did a tire manufacturer from France become the world\u2019s most prestigious reviewers of fine dining? The connection is tangential. Early adopters of automobiles needed a reason to travel; Michelin needed drivers to replace tires.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This insight was simple, but leveraging it gave them an enormous competitive advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep reading below to discover when to use this tactic and when to focus elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When to Use This Tactic<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the saying goes \u2013 timing is everything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How and when you expand your focus into other areas must be deliberate and calculated. Strategy is all about choice, and tangential content can be a distraction if not approached with intention and insight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t wake up one day, grab a coffee to go, then casually send a memo for your team to mass-produce content about restaurants because we all need to eat food. Such an approach is the fast way to achieve failure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two great reasons to expand your content horizons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business is an upstream supplier, so you want to build downstream demand<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business has exhausted all topically relevant content<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generating Demand<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s go back to the case of Michelin for a minute. Founded in 1889 in the city of Clermont-Ferrand, long before the Citro\u00ebn Type A popularised cars in Europe, Andr\u00e9 and \u00c9douard Michelin set out to save their grandfather\u2019s rubber manufacturing business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn\u2019t until a cyclist stopped by in the plant\u2019s courtyard with a flat tire that they hit upon their first major innovation. Previously, tires were glued on and a repair took several hours for glueing and drying. The Michelin brothers used this insight to create a tire that didn\u2019t require glue, and in doing so, they radically transformed the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the early 20th century, automobiles remained a luxury for the rich and adventurous, so the demand for tires was low by today\u2019s standards. To encourage people to drive, the first Michelin guide was released in 1900. Over the years, they refined the guide and by 1926 they reached the conclusion personal travel by car would be the future &#8211; and fine food could serve as the motivation people needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to the story is that the Michelin brothers continuously looked for ways to innovate. To them, the fine dining industry became an indistinguishable part of the automobile industry. Now, almost a century later, they\u2019re leaders in both; tangential content served as a reinforcement to their business model, not a distraction away from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding Horizons<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now let\u2019s imagine a coffee chain. There is an enormous opportunity to target relevant <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/module\/semantic-search\/keywords\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keywords<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but after a while, you find yourself running out of steam (pun intended), or maybe you\u2019ve got a new insight about your customers and want to expand your horizon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the moment when tangential content may have something to offer your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you consider your customers in a more holistic sense, you might notice that people who visit your chain prefer to sit alone and read a book. Suddenly, a book club idea is great \u2013 but for the same reason as before: It reinforces your core business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By itself, tangential content isn\u2019t particularly helpful. It needs to reinforce your business goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When To Avoid Tangential Content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the previous two points don\u2019t apply to you, your business hasn\u2019t exhausted your pool of content, and you\u2019re not struggling with demand in your industry \u2013 focus your time elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, aside from those, there are a few other reasons not to invest time and effort into tangential content:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diluting Resources<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negative Sum Competition<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diluting Resources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategy is always a choice. Two of your most precious resources for any venture are time and money. When you choose to prioritise tangential content, you\u2019re diverting time and money away from other areas of your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example is Pringles, a company first introduced to the market in 1968 and sold for $2.7 billion to Kellogg&#8217;s in 2012. The business was making $1.5 billion in revenue &#8211; why did Procter &amp; Gamble sell this successful product?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer is that although the product was a success, it was their only business left in the food industry. Allocating time and resources to supporting this product would take away from their main focus, so selling the business makes perfect sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same can be said for a tangential SEO strategy; if it isn\u2019t going to reinforce your core business goals &#8211; then it\u2019s time to pivot.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negative Sum Competition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocates for tangential SEO see the opportunity in reaching out from saturated markets, but doing so also increases the surface area of your business. You soon find that these green pastures have a wasp nest, and unlucky for you &#8211; you hit it on the way in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Procter &amp; Gamble invented a new technology capable of competing with the best bin bags and cling wrap in the market, they had the opportunity to enter the competition. If things went well, this market could be extremely lucrative, but if competitors reacted poorly, then they were opening a black hole to suck up cash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon scanning the environment, they realised this venture would likely invite an amount of competition that would be bad for all businesses involved &#8211; not ideal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the story doesn\u2019t end with them walking away with tails sufficiently tucked between their legs. Instead, they found a different strategy for success. In 2003, P&amp;G entered a joint venture with Clorox, the owners of Glad, and chose to avoid the wasp nest that waited for them if they launched their own product. Now, twenty years later, the partnership is ongoing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This story helps us understand that competition, while healthy, can become negative-sum. When entering a market, if you\u2019re not growing the market segment, all you\u2019re really doing is increasing the size of your competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Verdict on Tangential SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we look at a business like Michelin, we see huge potential in leveraging consumer insights to grow business, even through unconventional means. But if we look at Procter &amp; Gamble, we see a company that is happy to say no to markets that aren\u2019t in line with their strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether this approach is right for you or not will depend on whether you\u2019ve got unique customer insight to leverage and expand the market. If you\u2019re not struggling to generate demand and there is room for innovation in your existing market &#8211; we recommend restructuring existing market boundaries.<\/span><\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div clas=\"acfTesting\"><\/div>\n\n\t<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"acf-block-spacer-block_8d171e480fe18e3aaf6fcec347badf10\" class=\"acf-block-spacer c-pt-9\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<style>\ntable.blueTable {\n  border: 1px solid #1C6EA4;\n  background-color: #D9ECFF;\n  width: 100%;\n  text-align: center;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  margin-top: 30px;\n}\ntable.blueTable td, table.blueTable th {\n  border: 1px solid #AAAAAA;\n  padding: 3px 3px;\n}\ntable.blueTable tbody td {\n  font-size: 11px;\n  color: #333333;\n  display: table-cell;\n  padding: 5px;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  font-family: Campton,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Roboto,Helvetica Neue,Arial,sans-serif,Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Noto Color emoji;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead {\n  background: #9C7FB1;\n  background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #b59fc4 0%, #a68bb8 66%, #9C7FB1 100%);\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #444444;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead th {\n  font-size: 11px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  color: #FFFFFF;\n  text-align: center;\n  border-left: 1px solid #D0E4F5;\n   font-family: Campton,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Segoe UI,Roboto,Helvetica Neue,Arial,sans-serif,Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Noto Color emoji;\n}\ntable.blueTable thead th:first-child {\n  border-left: none;\n}\n\ntable.blueTable tfoot td {\n  font-size: 14px;\n}\ntable.blueTable tfoot .links {\n  text-align: right;\n}\ntable.blueTable tfoot .links a{\n  display: inline-block;\n  background: #1C6EA4;\n  color: #FFFFFF;\n  padding: 2px 8px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\ntd img {\n    max-width: 70px !important;\n}\n<\/style>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5815,"template":"","rd_category":[7,9,16],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What is Tangential SEO: A New Buzzword or Huge Opportunity?
