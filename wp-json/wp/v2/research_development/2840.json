Whether it\u2019s office drinks on a Friday afternoon, a gym membership, or unlimited holidays, there\u2019s always something to sweeten the deal for employees.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At SUSO, we are lucky to have an excellent team working out in Poznan, which meant I got the chance to spend some time working in the historic Polish city and see what it\u2019s like to still be in the EU (thanks, Brexit).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m Lewis, the Head of Client Success here at SUSO. Here\u2019s my little story of a trip to work in our Poznan office, discussing the work I focused on with our team, my exploration of the city, and also the wonderful people of Poland and their kindness in the face of a terrible war.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>My Journey Into Poland<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trip didn\u2019t get off to the best of starts, as our flight of 200 people was greeted at passport control by a total of 2 border agents. With the added complication of covid documents, let\u2019s just say time didn\u2019t exactly fly past. Although, I very much enjoyed the sarcastic Polish applause as additional border agents finally came to help with the long queues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I eventually reached the desk of my stone-faced border officer, things got even worse for me when he asked for my negative covid test. As a triple vaccinated individual, I had assumed I was immune not only to the virus, but also to international laws.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my high-pitched and nervous negotiating, he eventually dropped his tough-guy act and told me I could simply get a test in the airport lobby after I collected my luggage. I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t tell me this sooner because he enjoyed watching me squeal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I got my test and then headed to my apartment, relieved to be a free man in the place I would call home for the next 6 weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Daily Life At The Poznan SUSO Office<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I finally settled in, it was time to meet up with the team and get to work on some of our big projects planned for the first quarter of 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery Month<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the more important projects involved finalising a new service that we call Discovery Month. As a company, we noticed that our previous methods of quoting clients&#8217; campaigns based on the pre-sales analysis didn\u2019t always lead to the most accurate deliverables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, we decided to take the leap and instead turn all first months into a standardised month of auditing and strategising, which would allow us to provide a detailed roadmap of SEO work that was perfectly tailored to their websites and needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a lot of meetings, tests, and reviews to figure out the logistics for this new style of collaboration. Nevertheless, I\u2019m proud to say we got there in the end. We now have a polished Discovery Month service that will pave the way for all our future SEO work with our clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pod System<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another project we have been working on is restructuring our teams into dedicated micro teams called \u2018Pods\u2019 for more streamlined communication and clearer organisation. Previously our projects would be assigned to new project managers and technical managers based on available capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project managers are the ones that communicate with clients and organise the work, and the technical managers are the SEO experts that carry out the analysis and implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Project Managers and Technical Managers all working with one another, we noticed that this led to difficulties in prioritising deadlines, challenges with communication and also not the most efficient workflow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, to address this we decided to organise our projects so that the Project Manager &amp; Technical Manager worked on all the same ones, with no crossover. This allows for much more efficient communication, clearer structuring of work and a simplified workflow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far we\u2019ve noticed extremely positive feedback from the team, so it was great we could get this achieved during my stay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Exploring The City of Poznan<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amongst all the hard work, I made sure to find time to have fun with my team and explore the city a little bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For anyone who&#8217;s not been to Poznan, I&#8217;ll give you a brief summary of what you can expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poznan is what I&#8217;d call a Goldilocks city &#8211; not too big, not too small, but instead just the right size. It\u2019s one of those places that has everything you need but isn\u2019t overpopulated like a major city. You\u2019ve got bars, more cafes than you\u2019ll ever need, fantastic restaurants, and lovely old historical buildings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To top it off, there\u2019s a tram and plenty of electric scooters (my favourite mode of transport), so it\u2019s very easy to get around. But to be honest, it\u2019s so small you can basically walk anywhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the evenings, I would usually spend time doing fun activities with the team. Whether it was bowling, pool, grabbing beers, or singing our hearts out at karaoke, there was always something planned.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The karaoke was by far the highlight, although I\u2019m not sure if my rendition of Robbie Williams\u2019 \u201cAngel\u201d sounded as good to everyone else as it did in my own head.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, it really was fantastic getting to catch up with my work mates that I\u2019m so used to seeing over video calls. You simply cannot beat face-to-face interaction when it comes to getting to know people, and it\u2019s so important when you\u2019re working with them day in and day out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2842\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis.jpeg\" alt=\"Lewis &amp; Artur\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis.jpeg 1000w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-904x678.jpeg 904w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-53x40.jpeg 53w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-107x80.jpeg 107w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-40x30.jpeg 40w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-80x60.jpeg 80w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-32x24.jpeg 32w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-64x48.jpeg 64w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-24x18.jpeg 24w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/lewis-48x36.jpeg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>An Unexpected Hiccup (Or Cough)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an unfortunate turn of events, one day I woke up and began feeling a strange tickling sensation in my throat along with an unusual tiredness. You guessed it, I got covid!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seemed that Lady Luck was serving me some sweet irony for not getting my covid test before arriving in Poland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I spent the next 7 days isolating myself in my flat, using this time to really focus on my goals, awaken my spiritual side and achieve a state of optimum productivity. And what I mean by that is I used it as an excuse to try every burger available on Uber Eats and continue my recent bingeing of the US Office. Not a bad way to spend my prison sentence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I returned to civilization, I had the fun opportunity of checking out some new office spaces, as our team looked to upgrade to a bigger and more modern building for our growing team. After discussing with our different departments, we agreed on a new office space that has real potential for making work life even more convenient and comfortable, and will help attract even more talent to our Poznan team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2843\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid.jpeg\" alt=\"Covid Test\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid.jpeg 400w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-30x40.jpeg 30w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-60x80.jpeg 60w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-23x30.jpeg 23w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-45x60.jpeg 45w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-18x24.jpeg 18w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-36x48.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-14x18.jpeg 14w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/covid-27x36.jpeg 27w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Beauty of The Polish People<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2844\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest.jpeg\" alt=\"Crowd at Protest\" width=\"600\" height=\"1043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-23x40.jpeg 23w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-46x80.jpeg 46w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-17x30.jpeg 17w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-35x60.jpeg 35w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-14x24.jpeg 14w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-28x48.jpeg 28w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-10x18.jpeg 10w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/crowd-at-protest-21x36.jpeg 21w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, towards the end of my stay, the news of Russian troops lining up on the Ukrainian border was becoming more serious as the days progressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the invasion began, this horrendous situation was made even more real by the fact that members of our own team are from Ukraine and have families living there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one bright light in these dark times has been the response from Polish people, showing just how wonderful and compassionate they are to their Ukrainian neighbours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it was the support shown at protests to the war, with a sea of Ukrainian flags rippling through the air, or donation points popping up across the city for people to give clothes and supplies, the whole city seemed to spring into action to help in any way it could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I even heard stories of colleagues driving Ukrainians to neighbouring cities to help them reach a safe place to stay and instances of people opening up their homes to entire families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It made me proud to be connected to this wonderful city which showed me that even in the darkest of times, there are always good people who will do the right thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like to help the people of Ukraine through these tough times, please consider donating with any of the charities shown below (or any verified charity that you can find):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/donate.redcross.org.uk\/appeal\/ukraine-crisis-appeal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/donate.redcross.org.uk\/appeal\/ukraine-crisis-appeal<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/donation.dec.org.uk\/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/donation.dec.org.uk\/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savethechildren.org.uk\/donate\/single\/donation-single-00048\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.savethechildren.org.uk\/donate\/single\/donation-single-00048<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Returning Home<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As my time in Poland came to an end, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a mix of emotions.
